   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd psychiatric-records-app
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python -m psychiatric_app.main
   ```

### Development Setup

For development with full encryption support:

1. **Install SQLCipher system libraries**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libsqlcipher-dev libsqlcipher0
   
   # macOS with Homebrew
   brew install sqlcipher
   
   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install sqlcipher-devel
   ```

2. **Enable encrypted database**
   ```bash
   pip install pysqlcipher3
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### SQLCipher Dependency
**Issue**: Database encryption requires SQLCipher system libraries that are not available in all environments.

**Temporary Solution**: The application currently runs with standard SQLite (unencrypted) for compatibility.

**Resolution**: To enable full encryption:
1. Install SQLCipher development libraries for your system
2. Uncomment the `pysqlcipher3>=0.5.0` line in `requirements.txt`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Display Issues
**Note**: The application requires a graphical desktop environment. Remote or headless servers will need X11 forwarding or VNC.
